# Code-Quiz
This app is a quiz that tests your Javascript knowledge!

When you click the start button, a timer count-down starts and the user is presented with a question. When the user answers the question, they are presented with another question until the quiz is over. When the user answers a question incorrectly, then 10 seconds are subtracted from the clock. When all of the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, then the quiz is over and the user can store their high score with their initials and either clear the scores or start the quiz again.
